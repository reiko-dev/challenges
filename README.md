 This is the repository where I put codes like fun design and challenges



#To Do
- [ ] Paint square waves using the Fourier Series.
*The Fourier Transform takes a time-based pattern, measures every possible cycle, and returns the overall "cycle recipe" (the amplitude, offset, & rotation speed for every cycle that was found).

- [ ] Paint using the Fourier transform algorithm
